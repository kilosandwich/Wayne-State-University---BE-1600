#Hello, you are reading the Python Assignment 1 Question 2 for Wandyez
#Step 1: Copy and paste the entire assignment using a docstring, because going back and forth between a word document and VisualStudioCode is annoying
#docstrings can be created using three parentheses in a row at the beginning and end of a docstring
#Are there potentially horrible errors that could occur because docstrings are not technically comments? Yes, yes there are
#Is it easier? Yes, yes it is. 

#This entire program is very difficult to use because your instructions insisted on putting all programs together in one document

#Question 02 (4 points)

#Write a program that displays the result of
