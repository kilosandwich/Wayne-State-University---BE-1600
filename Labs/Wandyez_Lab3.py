1.
We can define the sum from 1 to x (i.e. 1 + 2 + ... + x) recursively as follows for integer x â‰¥ 1: 
1,                if x = 1 
x + sum from 1 to x-1                     if x > 1 
Complete the following Python program to compute the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 
recursively: 
def main():
 # compute and print 1 + 2 + ... + 10 
print sum(10) 
def sum(x):
# you complete this function recursively 
main()
